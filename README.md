It features a text area for writing and editing entries, a menu bar with options for saving, opening, and exiting, and a button to clear the text area. The "Save" option prompts the user to save their entry to a file, while the "Open" option allows them to load a previously saved entry.

## Quiz App
This Python script creates a simple quiz application using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The app presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers. The user selects an answer, and the app provides feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect. After answering each question, the user clicks a "Next" button to move to the next question. The quiz ends once all questions are answered, and the user's score is displayed in a message box. The app handles questions, options, and feedback dynamically and terminates once the quiz is complete.
